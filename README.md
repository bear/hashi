Web Hooks to XMPP bridge

Introduction
------------
Hashi in Japanese means bridge (æ©‹) (as least according to my Google searches) and
it will be a project that I use to bridge Web Hooks, and possibly other HTML(ish) things
to XMPP.

The first use will be to allow GitHub Web Hooks to get piped to XMPP.
